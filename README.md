Welcome to SEXT (Super Editor of Extreme Text), a program to edit .msg files in Rose Vengeance, an RPG!


The Messages.msg file is a file that holds all the messages in the game. It is the dialogue displayed when characters talk, sign dialogue, etc.


This program was started by Gota7, the creator of Rose Vengeance.



WRITTEN USING PROCESSING FROM PROCESSING.ORG



Features:

Real-time message previews.

Simplistic GUI

Font selection.

Easy load and export.

Add, delete, or edit messages.





Planned Features:


Export will prompt you where you want to save the file.




Controls:

A and S: change message pages (if more than 20).
D and F: change font pages (if more than 20).




Special Characters:

` make user press Z.

Special Notes:


For some weird char array glitch, it may add random periods at the end of each message, which is not hurtful to the game, since it loads an empty string.





Now it's time to begin SEXTing!
